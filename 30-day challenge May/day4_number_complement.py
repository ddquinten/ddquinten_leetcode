// Leetcode 30-day day 
// Description from leetcode
"""Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 

Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        x = int(math.log2(num)) + 1 # calculates actual num of bits in num
        # excludes leading zeroes
  
        # invert bits one by one  
        for i in range(x):  
            num = (num ^ (1 << i)) 
        return num
